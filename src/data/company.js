      about: 'The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) is the civic body that overlooks the city of Hyderabad, the capital of Telangana state. It is the local body for the cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. GHMC was formed on 16th April 2007, merging 12 municipalities and 8 gram-panchayats.',
      objective: 'GHMC was not satisfied with the manual attendance system for the sanitary field staff (SFA\'s) and the entomology staff in 5 zones under its jurisdiction. There were many false entries and manipulations happening which led to a huge financial loss for GHMC every month. So they wanted a modern and malpractice free biometric system for 22000 plus staffs assigned in each of these 5 zones.',
      solution: 'GHMC wanted a Aadhaar based biometric attendance system (AEBAS), which is linked to the aadhaar card details, so that manipulations can be avoided. Analogics provided them with LOTUS which is a handheld computer developed using Java or C language. It can be equipped with GPRS, 3G, WLAN or GSM, so that there is a database which is constantly updated with reports. LOTUS can be customized according the needs in this particular case a biometric sensor is used to scan the fingerprints. LOTUS is an encrypted attendance management system and provides an end-to-end solution that was much needed for the municipal body to govern staff attendance. This system also has geofencing which enables it to work only in zone numbering 6. With a error free database for attendance, payroll management system can be linked to it so that salaries are provided effortlessly.',
      result: 'With the new system in place, there is a steady increase in percentage of attendance which is approximately 70% compared to 30% with the conventional method. Which directly reflects in the average savings of ₹ 4.5 cr per month by GHMC. After witnessing the drastic change in figures, there are around 12000 units of LOTUS deployed in and around Hyderabad. Which eliminates the root cause of introducing this system: "bogus employees".',
